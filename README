This is a filetype plugin for CSV files. It was heavily influenced by the Vim
Wiki Tip667 (http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/VimTip667), though it works
differently.

See a Screencast of the plugin here: http://www.256bit.org/~chrisbra/csv.gif

Please vote for the plugin, if you like it!

This little filetype plugin allows among others:
 -  Display on which column the cursor is as well as number of columns
 -  Search for text within a column using :SearchInColumn command
 -  Highlight the column on which the cursor is using :HiColumn command
 -  Visually arrange all columns using :ArrangeColumn command
 -  Delete a Column using :DeleteColumn command
 -  Display a vertical or horizontal header line using :Header or :VHeader command
 -  Sort a Column using :Sort command
 -  Copy Column to register using :Column command
 -  Move a column behind another column using :MoveCol command
 -  Calculate the Sum of all values within a column using :SumCol command (you can also define your
    own custom aggregate functions)
 -  Move through the columns using the normal mode commands 
    (W forwards, H backwards, K upwards, J downwards)
 -  sets up a nice syntax highlighting, concealing the delimiter, if your Vim supports it
